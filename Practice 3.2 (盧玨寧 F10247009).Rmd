# You have the wrong elements in your list. you need to create a list using `list()`. The first element (1) is the data frame that you called 'weight'. The second element (2) is another list with 3 elements: a vector of character (2A), a numeric vector (2B), a dataframe (2C). The third element is the message that you called: BUBBLE_DIET. Check again all these elements, and try to use list () in order to make it correctly.
